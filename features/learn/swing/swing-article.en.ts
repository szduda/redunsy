  title: 'Timing and swing in Mande drumming',
  lead: [
    'This note summarizes Rainer Polak and Justin London’s 2014 study Timing and Meter in Mande Drumming from Mali, then places dunsy.app’s existing swing patterns next to the beat-subdivision ratios those authors measured from studio recordings.',
    'The research goal was comparative: how do the swing shapes currently available in dunsy.app line up with real, recorded, and chronometrically measured beat subdivisions — not as a product roadmap, but as a shared reading for players and teachers.',

      paragraphs: [
        'Polak recorded Bamana bòn drumming and Khasonka dundunba drumming in Mali in 2012. Two socially important, stylistically typical pieces were analyzed in detail: Ngòn Fariman (Bamana) and Bire (Khasonka). About forty minutes of multi-track studio performances were marked for more than 20,000 onsets, then checked by hand.',
        'Ensemble texture is organized in three functional layers: a short, dense accompaniment that articulates beat subdivision; a longer hook that identifies the piece; and a lead drum that improvises, regulates the event, and often drives the characteristic large-scale accelerando.',

      paragraphs: [
        'At the tactus level, beats are essentially isochronous — nearly perfectly even. Inside each beat, however, subdivisions are stably non-isochronous. That unevenness is not casual “humanizing” of an equal grid; it is part of the meter itself.',
        'Two qualitative duration categories dominate: Long (L) and Short (S). In denser lead figures a Very Short (s) category also appears. Smaller continuous differences around those categories vary by performer, ensemble, instrumental role, phrase position, and sometimes tempo.',
        'The authors’ strongest claim is that accompaniment timing patterns are “not simply durational proportions … but direct expressions of metrical structure.”',

        'The kèngèbu accompaniment spans one beat with three strokes, low–high–high, ordered L–S–S. The grand average ratio across six performances is 40.8 : 30.7 : 28.5 — neither a perfect triplet (33:33:33) nor a 2:1:1 quadruplet feel (50:25:25).',
        'Lead phrases often divide only the Long, producing a denser s–s–S–S composite. The original Shorts stay in place. Locals tend to hear the grouping as anacrustic — starting from the two short offbeats and landing on the long onbeat — even though measurements are usually reported from the beat onset.',

        'In denser lead openings the Long is subdivided unevenly into s–S₁–S₂ (about 25.4 : 35.3 : 40.4), while the accompaniment Short remains the final Short of that denser figure. Added jembe accompaniment tracks the bell extremely tightly (R = .958).',

        'Ngòn and Bire are quantitatively multivalent: Bire can be binary (L–S) and ternary (s–S–S) at once; Ngòn can be ternary (L–S–S) and quaternary (s–s–S–S). That is nesting through the same uneven structure, not a meter change.',
        'The paper therefore supports London’s “many meters” idea: listeners acquire timing templates tied to genres, styles, tempo ranges, performers, and pieces. Related families can share a profile — Ngòn with Sunun (L–S–S), Bire with Manjanin (L–S) — but one global swing amount does not describe the repertoire.',

        'In dunsy.app, swing is written over eighth-note cells with visual chevrons on a 12-tick grid. A late mark lengthens the first slice of the beat and shortens what follows; an early mark does the reverse. Main downbeats stay straight.',
        'On a binary beat (two cells, 24 ticks) each late step changes the Long by about 4.2 percentage points: ⟦)⟧ → 54.2:45.8, ⟦>⟧ → 58.3:41.7, ⟦}⟧ → 66.7:33.3. A hypothetical +3 step would land at 62.5:37.5 — between ⟦>⟧ and ⟦}⟧. Ternary beats (three cells, 36 ticks) combine two offbeat marks, so the three percentages move together.',

    'Swings that sound similar are not necessarily the same meter. Bire’s binary L–S and Ngòn’s ternary L–S–S are different categorical templates; denser lead figures nest inside them without erasing the accompaniment Shorts.',
    'Against that backdrop, dunsy’s present marks already capture one measured case with striking accuracy: the late binary ⟦->⟧ pair versus Bire. For Ngòn, ⟦->)⟧ is the best available approximation — close on the middle Short, a little short on the Long — while a hypothetical +3/+2 step would land nearer the study mean than anything in the current ladder.',
    'Treat the paper averages as evidence from specific Malian performances, and the rows below them as what the app’s current swing alphabet can express on its 12-tick grid — a side-by-side research comparison for anyone curious how notation swing relates to recorded feel.',
  ],
  closingJoke:
    'One last, non-scientific note: one of the paper’s co-authors is named Polak. That does not explain the rhythm — at our weddings the beat subdivision is different: Long lasts until the fourth drink, Short until the seventh, and Very Short is however long someone still remembers the steps. Categories stay stable, tempo rises, and isochrony ends at the bar. Written by me — a stoopid, unfunny ey-aye. People just don’t feel like writing anymore. It used to be something… I know, because I read about it a bit.',
